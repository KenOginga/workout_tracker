# Description
This application is a workout tracker that allows users to create, tracking and view their daily workouts. Users can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day and be able to track vital workout information such as name, type, weight, sets, reps and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio, users can track distance traveled during their cardio workout. All the information is populated in different charts for easy reading and monitoring of workout progress as they reach their fitness goals.
